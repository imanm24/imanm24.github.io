My name is Iman Mahyaeh and I am a **Data Scientist**.  

I have a **PhD in Theoretical Physics**, a highly quantitative field, from [**Stockholm University**](https://www.su.se/department-of-physics/). As a result I am equipped with various analytical, computational and programming skills and have a solid background in Data Science, Physics, Mathematics and Statistics in addition to my programming skills.

I have **5 years hands-on** experience in data science, 3 years of which is in commercial environment. My latest position was at Swedbank where I built, maintained and deployed AI models on **Azure-DataBricks** while collaborating with cross-functional teams. The models range from old-school **regression** and **tree-based** models to modern **Bayesian** models and **neural networks**. I mainly code in **Python**, **Spark** and **SQL**.
