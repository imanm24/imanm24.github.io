My name is Iman Mahyaeh and I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Swedbank, the bank with the longest history in Sweden.

I have a PhD in Theoretical Physics, a highly quantitative field, from Stockholm University. As a result I am equipped with various analytical, computational and programming skills and have a solid background in Data Science, Physics, Mathematics and Statistics in addition to my programming skills.

At Swedbank, I am a member of Credit Analytics - Decision Science team. Our team is responsible for developing and maintaining models which are being used by our colleagues in Decision Strategy and Credit Risks teams. These models range from old-school regression and tree-based models to modern Bayesian models and neural networks. To this end, I mainly work in Azure-DataBricks and code in Python, Spark and SQL.  

I am collaborative, reliable, flexible, and willing to learn new skills. My education and research background have developed me as a quick learner and taught me how to dive into a new or vaguely-framed problem and solve it, which, I believe, are crucial skills to be successful as a Data Scientist.
