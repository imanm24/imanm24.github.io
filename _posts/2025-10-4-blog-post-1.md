# Bayes' Theorem 

(*Remark*: We could be picky and rigorous and all of that and distinguish between a stochastic variable and the **value** that it takes. It is definitly a fair concern. There is no doubt about that. To my limited exprience, usually the distinction is clear and understandable from the context. Sometimes people start with the diference and at some point drop it. In a scientfic book or paper one may need to keep the distinction clear, but we drop it for the moment.)

The way that I understand the Bayes theorem is as follows. Let' say we want to calculate the joint probablity of $p(x,y)$, meaning the probability of having both $x$ and $y$ simultaneously. These are two tochastic variables that somehow are related or could be related to each other. For example, $x$ shows whether it is raining or not, and $y$ could show whether your neighbor picks up their umberella. Note that the adverb *simultaneously* does not mean they should definitely occur at the same *time*; their *actual* time of occurance could be different. *Simultaneously* here simply means logical AND operator. For instance, one could ask about the joint probability of attending a class during a term and passing its exam which comes in the end. 

Now let's think how we can calculate the joint probability. If we think 









\begin{equation}
E = mc^2
\label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}

As seen in Equation \(\ref{eq:energy}\), energy and mass are equivalent.


This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Headings are cool
======
$$
p(x) = \int p(x|y) p(y) dy
$$

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
