# Bayes' Theorem 

The way that I understand the Bayes theorem is as follows. Let' say we want to calculate the joint probablity of $p(x,y)$, meaning the probability of having both $x$ and $y$ simultaneously. These are two tochastic variables that somehow are related or could be related to each other. For example, $x$ shows whether it is raining or not, and $y$ could show whether your neighbor picks up their umberella. Note that the adverb *simultaneously* does not mean they should definitely occur at the same *time*; their *actual* time of occurance could be different. *Simultaneously* here simply means logical AND operator. For instance, one could ask about the joint probability of attending a class during a term and passing its exam which comes in the end. 

To undestand the theorem I usually go back to the frequentistic approach of probability and consider an example. It is handy to have an example at hand and understand all in that context. Let's consider the following example:

There is a city with two areas $(E, W)$. Each household has one car. Cars could have 3 colors $(R, G, B)$. Let's say there are 100 housholds, 40 of which in area $E$ and 60 of which in area $W$. To present the cars' colors we can use a tree structure:

- $E$
    - R: 14
    - G: 9
    - B: 17
- $W$
    - R: 25
    - G: 16
    - B: 19

We can, of course, look at it in a different way. We can start the tree by first dividing the housholds by their cars' color and then by the area they live in:

- $R$
    - $E$: 14
    - $W$: 25
- $G$
    - $E$: 9
    - $W$: 16
- $B$
    - $E$: 17
    - $W$: 19

We can now ask, how many people live in area $E$ *AND* (the logical one, *simultaneously*) have a blue car? To answer that we can do it in two ways:
1. Either first select people who live in area $E$, which are 40. And then see that among those 17 households have a blue car.
2. Or first select households with blue cars which are 36, and then select those who live in area *E* among them. Also lead to 17! 

> So the order we do the counting/selection does not matter.

Now let's go back to the joint probability. Let's ask what is the probability of randomly choosing a houshold in area $E$ with a blue car? 

Well, the result is $17%$, because 17 out of 100 household fulfill both conditions. Now let's calculate it using probabilities. Again we can do it in two ways:

We can first ask ourselves what is the probability of choosing a household from the area $E$. It is 40 out of 100: 

\begin{equation}
p(area = E) = 40/ 100 = 0.4 \ .
\end{equation}

As seen in Equation \(\ref{eq:energy}\), energy and mass are equivalent.


#(*Remark*: We could be picky and rigorous and all of that and distinguish between a stochastic variable and the **value** that it takes. It is definitly a fair concern. There is no doubt about that. To my limited exprience, usually the distinction is clear and understandable from the context. Sometimes people start with the diference and at some point drop it. In a scientfic book or paper one may need to keep the distinction clear, but we drop it for the moment.)
