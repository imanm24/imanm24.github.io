We define energy as:


\begin{equation}
E = mc^2

This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Headings are cool
======
$$
p(x) = \int p(x|y) p(y) dy
$$

You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
